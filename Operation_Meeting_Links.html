        <p>You are right the main cost increase is triggered by the claim of the civil contractor which results from two times suspension of the civil works. Both suspensions are triggered by the Yangtse protection law and related permitting issues. The permitting of this project started by bundling it together with the HDK DBN project and we achieved the construction license in Dec. 2021. After we faced the problem for the permitting in this bundle permit in mid of 2022, we decided to redo the permitting for the WH automation project in Q4/2022.</p>
        <p>For the civil contractor these permitting issues results in two times suspension of the construction work resulting in the cost increase.</p>
        <p>After we got construction license for the WH project in Dec. 2021, a national authority audit in the Jiangsu province has been announced in Q1/2022. We decided to stop the construction for the WH project until the audit was done (finally in April). After the audit, we decided to proceed the work for the HDK WH project even we were informed in June that Suzhou does not approve the energy permits necessary for new projects. When we finished the first parts (pallet WH and weighing bridge) in October 2022 and as we could not foresee a solution for the permitting issue of the HDK bundle, we decided to start an own permitting for the residual part of the HDK WH project (Expansion and automation of main warehouse). Therefore, we had to stop the construction for a second time in November 2022 until we got the second construction license in August 2023. Both times we had to mobilize and demobilize the teams. The contractor management team had to stay during the whole time “mobilised” as they have been assigned in our construction permits.</p> 
        <p>In combination with the 2nd permitting costs these two construction suspensions resulted in additional costs of 4,8 MCNY and are the main reason for the project revision.You can find the timeline more detailed on slide 3 of Mickey’s ppt and I hope this explanation gives a bit more background about the related permitting issues. If you have further questions, feel free to contact me.
